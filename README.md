# `changelog-go`

A Changelog Management Tool written in Go which is compatible with Linux,
Windows and Mac OS-X.

## Motivation

Think about that: You have a Project where you work with other 4-5 Peoples. How do you track changes so that they can
easily added to a Changelog File?

This Tool helps you to keep track of you Changelog (and changes) and its fully compatible with (eg) the Git Flow.
This Tool does **not** aim to replace Tools like _Jira_ moreover, it extends it.
Create Changelog Files easily with one Command (`changelog release <version>`).

Feature branches can contain Changelog Entries and can be merged whenever you want!
It does not break the functionality.

**And** this Tool does _not_ disturb any other Tool (eg IDE, CI/CD, Artifact, ...)
