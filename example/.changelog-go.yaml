preRelrease:
        # if you set 'detect' to true, changelog-go will automatically detect
        # if the released Version is an pre-release Version, so a User or CI/CD
        # has not to manually set the pre-release Flag.
        # To detect such pre-releases changelog-go is using the SemVer
        # definition of a pre-release.
        #
        # Example:
        #       1.0.0-alpha.1
        #       1.0.0-beta
        #       1.0.0-beta.2
        #       1.0.0-rc.1
        detect: true

        # setting 'deletePreRelease' to true will cause changelog-go to delete
        # the written Pre-Releases from the CHANGELOG.md file when releasing an
        # non-pre-release Version (eg. "1.0.0").
        deletePreRelease: false

        # 'foldPreReleases' will "fold" the Pre-Release entries if you release
        # an non pre-release.
        # To get this Feature working changelog-go uses the HTML tag "<details>"
        foldPreReleases: true
